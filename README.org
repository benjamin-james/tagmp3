* tagmp3
Edits ID3 tags of MP3 files to add album art from [[http://last.fm][Last.FM]]
* Installation
tagmp3 requires [[http://python.org][Python 3]] and the Python 3 libraries [[https://github.com/nex3/mutagen][mutagen]] and [[http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/][requests]]

To install, clone this repo and copy =tagmp3= to =~/bin= or another location in $PATH
* Usage
Usage: =tagmp3 songname.mp3=

To do this on your entire music library, for example in =~/music=,

Using GNU Parallel:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
find ~/music -name '*.mp3' | parallel tagmp3 "{}"
#+END_SRC

Or using =find='s /exec/ functionality:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
find ~/music -name '*.mp3' -exec tagmp3 "{}" \;
#+END_SRC

The MP3 file must already have name and artist info in order to fetch album art from Last.FM.

Note: This script may fail if the ID3 metadata doesn't match the format that Last.FM has on their database
