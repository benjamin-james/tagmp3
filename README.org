* tagmp3
Adds album art from [[http://last.fm][Last.FM]] to the ID3 tags of an MP3 file

It recognizes the song by either the filename format 'Artist_Name - Track_Name.mp3' or its already present artist and track ID3 metadata.
* Installation
tagmp3 requires [[http://python.org][Python 3]] and the Python 3 libraries [[https://github.com/nex3/mutagen][mutagen]] and [[http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/][requests]]

To install, clone this repo and copy =tagmp3= to =~/bin= or another location in =$PATH=

Or just by using cURL:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjamin-james/tagmp3/master/tagmp3 -o ~/bin/tagmp3
#+END_SRC
* Usage
Usage: =tagmp3 songname.mp3=

To do this on your entire music library, for example on =~/music=,

Using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel][GNU Parallel]]
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
find ~/music -name '*.mp3' | parallel tagmp3 "{}"
#+END_SRC

Or using =find='s /exec/ functionality:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
find ~/music -name '*.mp3' -exec tagmp3 "{}" \;
#+END_SRC

The MP3 file must already have name and artist info in order to fetch album art from Last.FM.

Note: This script may fail if the ID3 metadata doesn't match the format that Last.FM has on their database
